# Write a script to find the minimal and maximal
# This script is designed to find the minimal and maximal of a sequence of numbers

#We ask the user to input the numbers used in the min-max finder
number_list = input("Type numbers separated by spaces:")

#In this function we find the maximum and minimum value in the list of numbers
if number_list == "": 
    max_value = "None"

#Output of the script
print("The list of number is:", number_list)
print("The minimal number is:", min_value)
print("The maximal number is:", max_value)
